Droid Factory: Empire's Edge is an exciting simulation of managing a droid manufacturing factory for the Galactic Empire, where I had to efficiently allocate resources and optimize development processes, starting with an initial funding of $1,000,000 with the goal of doubling this amount. I developed a strategy for planning and resource distribution, determining the optimal number of developers and the number of sprints for each stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), while avoiding the effect of Brooks’s Law to maintain efficiency. Special attention was given to optimizing the SDLC: I carefully distributed sprints across stages such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment, ensuring a balance between production speed and the quality of the droids being manufactured. After fine-tuning all processes, I launched production, closely monitoring how my decisions affected the final outcome, which not only allowed me to double the Empire’s investment but also significantly exceed the expected financial success. As a result, I earned the flag THM{Ruler.of.the.SDLC.Droids}, confirming the successful management of the factory, and the project became a valuable experience in applying knowledge of SDLC, DevOps, and resource management, teaching me how to efficiently allocate tasks, consider constraints, and optimize processes to achieve maximum results.
